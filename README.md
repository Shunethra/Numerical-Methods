# Numerical-Methods
Involves MATLAB projects that use various Numerical methods to solve mathematical problems. I did these projects as part of my coursework for Numerical Methods course at my University.

Project 1:
Involves calaculation of Matrix Inverse, Gaussian Elimination, LU factorization and Gauss Seidel Iteration methods to solve for the current values in the provided circuit.

Project 2:
Calculates system outputs using Newton Raphson and Bisection Methods.

Project 3:
Solved Linear, Polynomial, Exponential functions and plotted graphs in the MATLAB software.
